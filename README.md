HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

=======
This is an Air India Lounge Survey I built for my internship there.  It is built using HTML5 boilerplate and 
it is optimized for smaller screens including mobile.  There is no back end it's only the front end, as I am
not profecient with the back end yet.
The project utilizes HTML/CSS and JavaScript/JQuery.  I used HTML5 Boilerplate to setup the basic framework as it
would allow me to have a stable base for a relatively simplistic website, and would have tools such as 
Modernizer and HTML5 Shiv and Normalizer.css to ensure consistency across all browsers.  
To ensure mobile browsing I created a breakpoint so that all devices below a width of 699 px would be formatted
in a way to ensure that the website would work accross multiple devices regardless of screen size. 
Also ensured it matched the general theme of the Air India website including the favicon on the left hand side of the tab.
